                This was a Game-Jam project that I completed with another developer and 4 artists.<br>
                I was responsible for all the trap functionality, making them as modular as possible so someone else could focus on the level design.
                Furthermore, I was also responsible for the camera system including the respawning when a player leaves view.<br>
                Lastly it was my responsibility to make sure all the collisions of the assets were accurate.

                The most important aspect I learnt to make in this project was how to code objects so that it is as intuitive as possible for the level
                designers to use. I made sure that all the variables that they would ever want to change, were all readily available.<br>
                They were able to customize almost all variables surounding how an object behaves, and in case of this cannon example, they could adjust
                the shooting angle by simply rotating the barrel.<br>
                This allowed the level designers to quickly create an interesting and variating level.
