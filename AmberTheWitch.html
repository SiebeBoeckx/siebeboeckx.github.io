                This was a Game-Jam project that I completed with 5 other developers, it was also my first time creating something in VR.<br>
                My responsibilities were the interactive book, post-its and their visuals, the recipes themselves, the task board and then hand-in + pointing system.

                The most interesting part of this project was learning how to interact in VR. The book needed a way for the player to switch pages to
                browse the potion recipies. I learnt the unreal VR system for the oculus quest and used this to then implement the input system on the book.
                Afterwards I also had to work with the VR system to make sure the player could move arond the post-its as well.
