                This project is what I created for my grad work. I tried to make a fluid simulation in Unreal Engine.<br>
                I didn't go with a particle based simulation since there are already a lot like this, so I went for a more mathematical approach.
                This aligns well with my relatively  high mathematical background before I started higher education.<br>
                I eventually made the project in both blueprint and C++ as one of my research questions was to compare the difference in calculation speeds.
                By the end of the project there were still 1 or 2 bugs left unfixed, largely because the project went a little out of scope. The lack of
                clear visuals is also something I would work on if I would return to the project.
