                This was the final group project of my DAE carreer. Created in a group of 6 and an external music composer, this horror, escape room, game was created over the timespan of a semester.<br>
                I am extremely proud of our result as it exceeds the expectations of both the team AND the teachers.<br>
                Since we were so satisfied with the result, we had decided to submit Prysn to the Rookie Awards.

                My main input into the game was creating everything related to the enemies and their interactions.<br>
                I designed how the crawlers would wander the level, or rather how they'd patrol their territory.
                I created their hearing system, including creating ways for the other programmer to mask sound when the player hides.
                Add to this that I also had to make sure the crawlers couldn't hear the player if they're in a vent.<br>
                I also created the spotting system on the lighthouse, this includes following the player when they do spot them and calling all nearby crawlers to that location.<br>
                Next I created the bottle throwing mechanics, to distract crawlers. I also created the code functionality, randomizing them every new playthrough.<br>
                Last but not least I had a large part in designing the level layout, the final prototype was fully designed by me and the one used in the project is heavily inspired by it.
